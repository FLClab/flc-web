During my PhD I combined functional assays, super-resolution imaging and computational tools to quantitatively assess and explore synaptic protein organization and remodeling due to synaptic plasticity. Being a scientist for me is not a job, but a lifestyle in which I can be continuously curious and explore across fields, be it from neuroscience, photonics to machine learning.
