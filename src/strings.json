            "description": "Microscopy has revolutionized the biological sciences, but there are many biological questions that conventional microscopy is unable to answer due to the diffraction of light in conventional systems. A conventional light microscope is unable to visualize objects smaller than the diffraction limit of ~250 nm. Our lab uses and develops super-resolution microscopy methods to visualize objects smaller than the diffraction limit in both fixed and living cells."
