A conventional light microscope is unable to visualize objects smaller than the diffraction limit of ~250 nm. Our lab uses and develops super-resolution microscopy methods to visualize objects smaller than the diffraction limit in both fixed and living cells."

Thus, my PhD project, co-supervised by Dr. Flavie Lavoie-Cardinal and Dr. Paul De Koninck, is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the remodeling of the synaptic cytoskeleton during long-term potentiation, a phenomenon involved in memory.
