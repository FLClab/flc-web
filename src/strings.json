            "description": "Microscopy has revolutionized the biological sciences, but there are many biological questions that conventional microscopy is unable to answer due to the diffraction of light in conventional systems. A conventional light microscope is unable to visualize objects smaller than the diffraction limit of ~250 nm. Our lab uses and develops super-resolution microscopy methods to visualize objects smaller than the diffraction limit in both fixed and living cells."

My interest in psychology also further motivated me to start a master’s degree in Neuroscience. In Flavie’s lab, I will now combine STED microscopy and functional imaging to try to elucidate causal mechanisms of different diseases like ALS and Parkinson’s disease. I will focus on synaptic symptoms in these disease models."

During my PhD I combined functional assays, super-resolution imaging and computational tools to quantitatively assess and explore synaptic protein organization and remodeling due to synaptic plasticity. Being a scientist for me is not a job, but a lifestyle in which I can be continuously curious and explore across fields, be it from neuroscience, photonics to machine learning. In another life, I would be a diplomat who writes fiction books on the side."
